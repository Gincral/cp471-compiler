'python3 main.py input_file_address output_file_addressâ€™
<br/><br/>
python src/main.py input/test1.txt output/result.txt<br/>
or <br/>
python3 src/main.py input/test1.txt output/result.txt<br/>
<br/>
We provide 5 different test cases: test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt, test4.txt, test5.txt, you can try them all in input_file_address


# Requirement

When submitting the final project and presentation,  you  must document the contribution (in percentage) made by each team member in the project.
 
Target Assembly Code Generation Submission (Implemented version and proof of execution)
along with 2COOL! project presentation (submit a link)
Submit one file per group
Weightage: 20% plus *bonus 5%
* Bonus depends upon the extent of code optimization achieved in the final submission
======================================================================
The deliverable for this assignment consists of an implemented version of the compiler designed so far.
1. Submit the compiler code
2. Submit the 3 test cases
3. Submit a recorded/live demonstration of your working compiler code (15-20 minutes)
4. Presentation should include the inputs (consumed) and outputs (produced) by the various phases of the compiler. These should be produced by the compiler program implemented by you. Particularly, input provided to the lexer, and its output and the symbol table contents. Show the input of the token streams to the parser and the semantic analyser and the annotated output produced and the symbol table contents. Show the intermediate code generated, and finally the assembly code output for three selected test cases. Your presentation should also include a conclusion stating your experience accomplishing the project goals. Also mention the learnings achieved while working on the project.
5. Also, document and submit the presentation material.
  Please note mainly there are four phases in the compiler design that we are concerned with. These are (1) lexer, (2) parser and semantic analyser, (3) intermediate code generation, and (4) code generation. The submission is worth 20%. A correct implementation of each of the phase stands for a 5% weight.
